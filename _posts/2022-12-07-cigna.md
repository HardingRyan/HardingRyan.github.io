I am excited to share that I will be joining #TeamCigna this summer as an intern in the Cigna Technology Early Career Development Program!

I am so grateful for this amazing opportunity and so excited to learn and grow under great mentors at a great company. Learn more about Cigna [here](https://www.cigna.com/) and the roles associated with the TECDP [here](https://jobs.cigna.com/us/en/technology-early-career-development-program).
