<strong>Find out more about who I am [here](/about/) if you haven't already done so.</strong>

This website is made using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a Ruby-based static website framework provider, alongside [Bundle](https://bundler.io/), a manager for Ruby projects which streamlines the gem control process. This website is additionally hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and enabled through [FlatIcon](https://www.flaticon.com/).

The purposes of this website are to:
 - further highlight myself as an individual 
 - provide an environment for me to demonstrate and thorougly explain any coding projects that I create
 - allow me to communicate developments relating to my career and occupations, and
 - share any developments in the technological world which I find to be engaging, important, or otherwise noteworthy.

I believe that the only way to learn about programming is to do it. I hope that this website will not only encourage me to use computers to solve the problems around me, but also inspire others to do the same.

I will be updating the website whenever I get the chance, so please come back every once and a while to see my progress. Thank you for visiting!
