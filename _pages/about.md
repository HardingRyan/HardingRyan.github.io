<h3><strong>Hello!</strong><img src="\assets\images\hello.png" width="30" height="30" alt="Greetings"></h3> My name is Ryan Harding, and I am an undergraduate student currently enrolled at the University of Texas at Austin. I am majoring in computer science with the intent of obtaining a data science certificate. At UT, I am a member of the Association for Computing Machinery and the Information and Systems Security Society, as well as the University of Texas Longhorn Band.

I am fascinated by computer systems. The more I learn about them, the more I become inspired to contribute to this revolutionary world of technology. While my primary interests within this field consist of full-stack development, data processing, and cybersecurity, I am and always will be engrossed in all areas of computer science. I am a firm believer in using technology to promote sustainability, social responsibility, and life-saving discoveries.

Please feel free to shoot me an email <a href="mailto: rn.hardingg@utexas.edu">here</a> if you would like to connect. Thank you for visiting my website!
